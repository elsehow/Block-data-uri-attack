There is a new phishing exploit going around in which [[https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/01/gmail-phishing-data-uri/][data URIs]] are being used for phishing.
In one particularly nasty exploit, links are made to look like GMail attachments.

A browser extension that you (or someone who cares about you) installed has redirected you from the data URI you clicked on to this informative page.

If you are *sure* the page you clicked on is not malicious... 

1. Navigate to =chrome://extensions= and disable *Block data URI attack* (uncheck "Enabled").
2. Follow through to your link.
3. Navigate to =chrome://extensions= and /re-enable/ *Block data URI attack*.

Tips for general safety:

- Turn on [[https://www.google.com/landing/2step/][2-step verification]] on your Google (and other!) online accounts.
